    <string name="bio">Didn\'t know to deal with fame was such a hassle\nAlways wanted to blow up, climb the stage and touch the mic too\nI was in love with the rappers I saw on TV screens\nAnd so I mouthed a freestyle to every living being I came across\n\nAnd that right there was how it started\nFrom memorizing the words of Eminem back in high school\nTo making sure I could rap faster than anyone I ever came across\I was Shady in his shorts, I was skillful with the words\n\nTil i realized that that was not it\nWasn\'t supposed to be talking another rapper\'s topic\nIt was about me and my verses are my gospel\nI gotta preach it\nAnd some people gonna love it, some people just can\'t ignore it\n\nBecause my words caress them softly in the soul and sink into the bottom of it like the Titanic in the Atlantic\nThey become my apostles\The people who believe in me at every turn and listen to my every word\n\nWrong idea because J. Cole taught me\nBeing a real one is only about recording thoughts and\nto look beyond the fame and influence the games that come with\nbeing a star because the fame come with its own problems\n\nSo I\'m in my bedroom I\'m writing down what I think\nWhen I find I\'m in a dark place I put my paper to ink\nThese verses are my therapy, this paper is my shrink\nBout to fall over the edge, it saves me when I\'m on the brink of it\n\nAnd I will never sell my soul I\'ll never ever think of it\nI\'ll always do me in my verses else my words will mean nothing\nI\'ll bring my deep thoughts to the surface, hope that you find peace in it\nand find truth in these words, in this world there\'s little left of it\n\nI hope that when you hear me rapping I register deeply\nI hope that when I\'m no longer around you\'re gonna miss me\nThat\'s all I ever wanted\nCall it my greater purpose\nThat\'s the only thing I count as blessings in the morning\n\nWhen I know that when I rap, somebody listens to me\nWhen I know that when I\'m gone they\'ll pour this liquor for me\nWhen I\'m gone to heaven and somebody singing for me\n\nThat\'s when this semi automatic that I\'m pressing on my brain will be worth it</string>
